# parkingrid
Finding an empty parking slot in a densely populated country like india is such a hassle and with the increase of fuel price we don't want to waste it, so there comes ParkinGrid for the help.
ParkinGrid scans the area within it's range and lets the user know about the nearest empty slot, with help of openCv we will scan the live video that we will get from the camera and to not disturb the privacy we will take the video as a greyscale video on which we will be able to see only the pixels and the program will give the output of how many parking slots are available.
In future we will add more features like booking ticket in advance the way we do that with booking movie tickets.
